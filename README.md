# UK Government Department hierarchy and organograms

[Departmental organograms](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/hacking-organograms-unlocking-government-data) are a great example of how transparency data can be used to assess Government effectiveness.  
In May 2010, [David Cameron wrote](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/letter-to-government-departments-on-opening-up-data) to government departments asking them to publish an organogram showing a snapshot of their staff - the salaries, grades, roles, professions and units - every six months.  

## Preview

For a preview of the hackday work in your browser see this [link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mammykins/organogram/blob/master/hackday.html). This work was completed as part of a hackday organised by the Institute for Government.

## data.tree

We extract the data for each department from the multi-tabbed raw data. We tidy the data a bit and then explore using data.tree to structure the data and provide the inherent hierarchy. This is useful for its analysis and exploration which we begin here.

## Open data

The data is open and available in this repo or a link to it found [here](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/hacking-organograms-unlocking-government-data), at the bottom of the page.
